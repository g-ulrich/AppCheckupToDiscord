# ScreenShotToDiscord
## A PYQT5 GUI app that updates a specified discord channel according to a registered password.

This app works with a private project called GYM_Trade. The user.db that this app is predicated on recieves information ONLY from the flask based trading algorithm.

This app can be run by going to the dist folder and downloading the .exe. This app has not been authenticated by a proper cert, because it was homemade and is intended to be used on a case by case basis. Due to this app not being authenticated the download will be flagged as a virus, its not. Trust me :D

The app cannot be properly run wihtout a password/pin entry that is predicated on the user data which was registered in the GYM_Trade flask app.
